# ðŸ§  GitHub Copilot Instructions:
# After writing or changing any code in this project, do the following steps:
#
# âœ… 1. If it doesn't exist, create a folder: `docs/`
# âœ… 2. Inside `docs/`, create or append to a file called `change_log.md`
# âœ… 3. For every major change you make, write a log entry in markdown format:
#     - Include:
#         - Date in format `## YYYY-MM-DD`
#         - A list of file(s) changed
#         - What was added/modified
#         - Why it was done (purpose of the change)
#
# âœ… 4. Follow this exact format for consistency:
#
# ## 2025-07-09
# - `ec2_recovery.py`: Added function to detect EC2 instance failure and launch a replacement via Boto3.
# - `playbook.yml`: Created Ansible play to install required services.
# - Purpose: Automate EC2 recovery and ensure system stays self-healing.

# âž• Important: Every future Copilot suggestion should include a log entry in `docs/change_log.md`
# to help developers understand the full change history and reasoning.
