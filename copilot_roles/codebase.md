"Hi Copilot. Iâ€™ve just cloned a new project. Please scan, index, and understand the full codebase, including main modules, dependencies, configuration files, and folder structure.

Prepare to help me continue development by:

    Understanding the purpose of each major file/folder

    Identifying how the main components interact

    Noting the frameworks, libraries, or APIs used

    Recognizing any build, test, or CI/CD configurations

Let me know if there are any key things I should read or set up before continuing."
