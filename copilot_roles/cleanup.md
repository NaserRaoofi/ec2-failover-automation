Hi Copilot, I want to perform a safe and smart cleanup of my project.

Please help me identify and remove:
- Unused variables, functions, classes, or imports
- Temporary/test files or folders that are not referenced in production code
- Duplicate or redundant code blocks
- Unused dependencies in requirements.txt or package.json
- Leftover debug code (e.g., print/log statements meant for testing)
- Empty or outdated configuration files
- Code comments or TODOs that are outdated or unclear
- Orphaned components, scripts, or modules

⚠️ Important: This must be done **carefully** — do not automatically delete anything. I want to review all changes step by step.  
Ask before removing anything that might break the project.

Start by scanning the full codebase and summarizing:
- What looks safe to delete
- What is risky or may require manual confirmation
- Any structural or architectural suggestions for better organization

Let’s start by reviewing the unused or redundant files and code blocks. Then we’ll continue to cleanup imports, dependencies, and config.
