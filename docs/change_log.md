- **Purpose**: Enable deployment of simplified EC2 infrastructure with proper tooling setup

### Successful EC2 Infrastructure Deployment
- **Role**: DevOps Engineer (see copilot_roles/devops_engineer.md)
- **Action**: Terraform deployment completed successfully
- **Resources Created**: 20 AWS resources in us-east-1 region
  - 1 VPC (vpc-0988c9ef56c228476)
  - 1 EC2 instance (i-0c028a7e67ade7833) - t3.micro in private subnet
  - 2 NAT Gateways for high availability
  - 4 subnets (2 public, 2 private) across multiple AZs
  - Security groups, route tables, and networking components
- **Security**: Instance in private subnet with encrypted EBS volume
- **Cost**: Free tier eligible EC2, NAT Gateways ~$64/month
- **Purpose**: Successfully deployed production-ready EC2 infrastructure with AWS best practices

### Infrastructure Cleanup Complete
- **Role**: DevOps Engineer (see copilot_roles/devops_engineer.md)
- **Action**: Terraform destruction completed successfully
- **Resources Destroyed**: All 20 AWS resources successfully removed
  - VPC, EC2 instance, NAT Gateways, subnets, security groups, etc.
  - No remaining AWS charges or resources
- **State**: Terraform state file shows empty state (no managed resources)
- **Cost Impact**: Zero ongoing AWS costs after cleanup
- **Purpose**: Complete infrastructure teardown to avoid unnecessary charges

### Route 53 Module Creation and Load Balancer Integration
- **Role**: AWS Architect (see copilot_roles/aws_architect.md)
- **New Module**: Created `modules/route53/` with main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf
- **Features**: DNS management, A records, health checks, CloudWatch alarms
- **Integration**: Route 53 connects to Application Load Balancer via alias records
- **Configuration**: Added domain_name, create_hosted_zone, health_check options
- **Environment**: Uncommented load balancer module in dev environment
- **Variables**: Added Route 53 variables to dev/variables.tf and terraform.tfvars.example
- **Outputs**: Added Route 53 outputs for hosted zone ID, name servers, and FQDNs

- **Purpose**: Enable custom domain names with DNS management and optional health monitoring

### Load Balancer and Route 53 Integration Analysis
- **Role**: DevOps Engineer (see copilot_roles/devops_engineer.md)
- **Analysis**: Explained Route 53 optional configuration for dev/test environments
- **Solution**: Route 53 module conditionally created only when domain_name is provided
- **Dev/Test Setup**: domain_name = null means no DNS resources, use Load Balancer DNS name directly
- **Cost Optimization**: No Route 53 charges for development/testing environments
- **Access Method**: Application accessible via Load Balancer DNS name (auto-generated by AWS)
- **Production Ready**: Easy to enable Route 53 by setting domain_name variable
- **Purpose**: Flexible DNS configuration suitable for all environments from dev to production

### AWS Cost Analysis and Tracking
- **Role**: AWS Architect (see copilot_roles/aws_architect.md)

- **Cost Breakdown**: EC2 ($7.59), ALB ($16.20), NAT Gateways ($64.80), EBS ($0.64), EIPs ($7.30)
- **Optimization Options**: Documented 3 cost reduction strategies (single AZ, NAT instances, public subnet)
- **Production Estimates**: $124.75/month with Route 53 and monitoring enabled
- **Free Tier Benefits**: Detailed first-year savings analysis
- **Monitoring Setup**: Billing alerts, cost allocation tags, and review schedules
- **Commitment**: Keep cost document updated with every infrastructure change
- **Purpose**: Transparent cost management and optimization for all environments

### Architecture Refactoring - Separated Concerns Implementation

- **Removed**: `modules/ec2/` - Eliminated redundant code duplication
- **Enhanced**: `modules/launch_template/` - Now the single source of truth for instance configuration
- **Enhanced**: `modules/autoscaling/` - Dedicated Auto Scaling Group management
- **Updated**: `docs/architecture.md` - Reflects new separated concerns architecture
- **Purpose**: Implemented clean separation of concerns following single responsibility principle. Launch Template module handles instance configuration, Auto Scaling module handles availability and scaling. This eliminates code duplication and improves maintainability.

**Architecture Impact**: 
- Reduced code duplication by 100+ lines
- Improved module separation and clarity
- Enhanced maintainability and testing
- Better follows Terraform best practices

### Project Status: COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Modular Terraform infrastructure designed and implemented
- ✅ Role-based Copilot system established and documented
- ✅ AWS infrastructure successfully deployed and tested
- ✅ All resources cleaned up (zero ongoing costs)
- ✅ Complete documentation and automation scripts
- ✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub repository
- **Next Steps**: Project ready for production deployment when needed
