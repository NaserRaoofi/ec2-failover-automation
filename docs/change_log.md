- Purpose: Create ready-to-use development environment with sensible defaults.

### Automation Scripts
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: Created interactive deployment script with validation and confirmation.
- `scripts/cleanup.sh`: Created destruction script with safety prompts.
- Purpose: Simplify deployment and cleanup processes with user-friendly automation.

### Documentation
- `docs/getting-started.md`: Comprehensive setup and usage guide for new users.
- `docs/architecture.md`: Detailed architecture documentation with diagrams and explanations.
- Purpose: Provide clear guidance for project setup, usage, and understanding of the infrastructure design.

### Summary
This initial setup establishes a complete, production-ready modular Terraform infrastructure for EC2 failover automation with:
- Multi-AZ high availability
- Automatic scaling and healing
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Easy deployment automation
- Thorough documentation

## 2025-07-09 (Continued)

### AWS Architect Role Activation
- **Role**: AWS Architect (see copilot_roles/aws_architect.md)
- **Task**: EC2 architecture consultation and design
- **Analysis**: Reviewed existing infrastructure and provided Well-Architected Framework guidance
- **Purpose**: Ensure EC2 creation follows AWS best practices for reliability, security, and cost optimization

### EC2 Module Simplification
- **Role**: AWS Architect (see copilot_roles/aws_architect.md)
- `modules/ec2/main.tf`: Simplified from Auto Scaling Group to basic EC2 instance with AWS best practices
- `modules/ec2/variables.tf`: Updated variables for simplified EC2 configuration with production-ready options
- `modules/ec2/outputs.tf`: Modified outputs to provide EC2 instance details and SSH connection info
- **AWS Architect Decisions Applied**:
  - Used GP3 EBS volumes for better price/performance
  - Enabled EBS encryption for security
  - Added comprehensive tagging strategy
  - Included optional Elastic IP for static IP requirements
  - Detailed monitoring option for enhanced observability
  - Free tier eligible defaults (t3.micro)
- **Purpose**: Create a simplified, cost-effective EC2 module while maintaining AWS Well-Architected Framework principles

### Development Environment Updates & Terraform Installation
- **Role**: DevOps Engineer (see copilot_roles/devops_engineer.md)
- `environments/dev/main.tf`: Updated EC2 module call to use simplified configuration
- `environments/dev/variables.tf`: Added new variables for simplified EC2 module
- `environments/dev/outputs.tf`: Updated outputs for simplified EC2 instance information
- **System Setup**: Installed Terraform v1.12.2 using snap for infrastructure deployment
- **Issue Resolution**: Fixed Makefile command syntax (use `make dev-apply` not `make dev apply`)
- **Purpose**: Enable deployment of simplified EC2 infrastructure with proper tooling setup

### Successful EC2 Infrastructure Deployment
- **Role**: DevOps Engineer (see copilot_roles/devops_engineer.md)
- **Action**: Terraform deployment completed successfully
- **Resources Created**: 20 AWS resources in us-east-1 region
  - 1 VPC (vpc-0988c9ef56c228476)
  - 1 EC2 instance (i-0c028a7e67ade7833) - t3.micro in private subnet
  - 2 NAT Gateways for high availability
  - 4 subnets (2 public, 2 private) across multiple AZs
  - Security groups, route tables, and networking components
- **Security**: Instance in private subnet with encrypted EBS volume
- **Cost**: Free tier eligible EC2, NAT Gateways ~$64/month
- **Purpose**: Successfully deployed production-ready EC2 infrastructure with AWS best practices
